    "description": "Our gigantic Q-Fig Max diorama captures the moment of pure joy Harry Potter experiences as he gives in to the thrill of his first flight on the Hippogriff Buckbeak. With his arms extended and head back, Harry closes his eyes and revels in the magic of the moment. Buckbeak's wings are fully extended and his tail trails out behind him as he glides majestically over the surface of Hogwart's lake. The hippogriff's paws skim the water's surface, causing ripples to trail behind, craved into his base.  The Harry and Buckbeak diorama is massive - Buckbeak's wingspan is 13 inches wide and he is 8 inches from beak to tail. No detail was spared by our QMx creative team, from Harry's Gryffindor tie billowing in the wind to the delicately sculpted feathers on Buckbeak's wings.  Continuing in the tradition of the first Q-Fig Max from the Wizarding World, Harry and Hagrid, this piece is a numbered, limited-edition collectible and includes a signed Certificate of Authenticity.  In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid is appointed Professor of Magical Creatures and introduces the class to Buckbeak, a hippogriff. The one student brave enough to approach the impressive beast is Harry Potter, who befriends the creature and enjoys an exhilarating ride over the lake. The two bond and form a friendship that would carry them through the Battle of Hogwarts and beyond.  Harry &amp; Buckbeak is cast in Everstone™, a proprietary high-temperature polymer developed by QMx. Everstone™ offers discerning collectors everything they require in a high-quality collectible: fantastic durability, solid weight, and precisely-crafted details that resist both fading and fracture. Everstone™ is everything traditional polystone statues are not – strong yet pliable with the ability to capture minute details in costumes, scenery, and action.",

Beast Kingdom Entertainment Experience Brand presents the latest installment in the Master Craft series, which is loved by collectors around the world. The new piece is the Dark Night Memorial Statue, based on the Christian Bales' Batman in the film The Dark Knight Rises. The statue realistically recreates Bruce Wayne donning the Batsuit. In order to save Gotham City from a nuclear bomb, Batman flew his personal flying machine, the Bat, out over the water with the bomb so that it could detonate away from the city. For his sacrifice, Gotham built a memorial statue of Batman.  The Master Craft series continues its tradition of precision and beauty. Molded and painted by hand with great attention to detail, this statue is faithful to the film. Not only are the statue and platform extremely detailed, but they also exhibit a very realistic aging effect. This item is not to be missed by collectors and fans of Batman and the Dark Knight trilogy.  Add it to your collection today!",

Lee Bermejo's Joker design is very dark with stunningly realistic features. Even the base is specially designed by Mr. Bermejo featuring Batman (from Batman: Noel graphic novel) chained to a stone which gives the whole statue even darker look.

    "description": "Why so serious? One of the most famous lines in recent movie history, uttered by arguably one of the most famous villains: 'The Joker', still resonates with movie lovers to this day!  The release of 'The Dark Knight' heralded a new type of superhero, and with it a new type of villain! Heath Ledger's take on the 'Clown Prince of Crime' is often considered as the definitive portrayal of the crazed comic-book villain. Bursting on to the screens in 2008 and changing the landscape for superhero movies forever, nothing like it had been seen before. With every good hero, a counter villain is a must, and this version of Joker took this notion of good vs evil to the next level! With clever makeup, a distinct taste for destruction, and very anarchistic motives, the Joker from the Dark Knight is fondly remembered by fans the world over!   Sideshow and Beast Kingdom, The Entertainment Experience Brand, are proud to introduce the latest D.A.H (Dynamic 8ction Heroes) action figure from the second in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight: Joker has 28 points of articulation, giving fans and collectors the very best in posable, realistic design. Conversely a huge amount of focus is given to The Joker's clothing, something the character himself took great pride in. Everything from the stitching down to the detailed buttons, a real metallic chain, and more are beautifully recreated. A detailed head sculpt brings The Joker's manic look to real life. Finally not forgetting the D.A.H signature inclusion of a bevy of accessories, including four sets of hands, pistols, bazookas, hand grenades, and more, means collectors are in no shortage of ways to pose and recreate their favorite scenes from the movie.  The most infamous superhero villain of all-time most certainly needs an epic figure to match! So make sure this Joker is in your collection and relive his unforgettable scenes on your desk today!",

From villains like Killer Croc, Bane, and Brainiac to Batman's own comrades, including Superman and Cyborg, the file brings together the Dark Knight's fascinating personal theories on the unique anatomical composition of these formidable individuals.   This stunning and unique book delves into the incredible abilities of DC Comics characters like never before. Using beautifully illustrated anatomical cross sections depicting twelve different DC characters, the book, told from Batman's unique perspective, will explore how these metahumans' physical makeup differs significantly from that of the average person. From detailed theories on how Superman's eyes shoot heat rays to an in-depth exploration of how Aquaman is able to breathe underwater, the book delves into the deepest secrets of these classic characters. Also featuring chapters on the anatomy and abilities of Doomsday, Aquaman, Swamp Thing, Darkseid, Martian Manhunter, and more, this one-of-a-kind book will change the way you look at metahumans forever.",

The original painting has long garnered special recognition and praise among the Superman fan community, as well as with Reeve himself, who acknowledged Someone To Believe In as a personal favorite fan tribute to his portrayal of the Man of Steel and kept a replica of the original painting proudly hung behind the desk in his home office.  For the first time ever, fans will have an opportunity to bring home an officially licensed, faithful reproduction of this fine masterpiece by Meadows.

For every Batman there has to be a super-villain like The Joker, and for every Superman, a Lex Luthor. This deluxe book celebrates nearly eighty years of compellingly corrupt characters from the DC Universe's remarkable gallery of super-villains. From the Penguin to Harley Quinn and Doomsday to General Zod, DC Comics: Super-Villains explores the story of these beloved baddies through new interviews with acclaimed writers and artists, including Jim Lee, Mike Carlin, Dan DiDio, and Chuck Dixon. Charting the dynamic way in which DC Comics evildoers have evolved throughout the years, the book brings together the very best super-villain art from the DC Comics archives. Also featuring a foreword by filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith, and an exclusive cover illustrated by acclaimed artist Phil Jimenez, DC Comics: Super-Villains is the ultimate celebration of the nefarious DC Comics characters that fans love to hate.",

    "description": "Boba Fett is the most infamous bounty hunter in the Star Wars galaxy. His first public debut was on September 24, 1978 in the San Anselmo County Fair parade in California, the home of Lucasfilm at the time. Shortly thereafter, we find out more about him in the Star Wars Holiday Special in an animated feature. He actually saves Luke Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2 from a monster and seems to be a friend trying to help them. But then he reveals that he is actually working for Darth Vader! In 1997, Boba Fett was added to the Special Edition of Star Wars: A New Hope.  We next see Boba Fett in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back as one of the 6 bounty hunters that Darth Vader hires to capture Luke, along with Princess Leia, Han Solo and Chewbacca. He tracks the Millennium Falcon to Lando Calrissian's Cloud City, where Darth Vader hands over Han, encased in carbonite, to the bounty hunter to take to Jabba the Hutt to collect his reward.  Boba Fett meets his fate in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with the Sarlacc in the Great Pit of Carkoon on Tatooine.  The master patterns for the EFX helmet were made from a direct casting of the screen-used helmet. Also, the paint reference and even the timing of the blinking LED's in the rangefinder are based on an extensive study of the original helmet!",

Encased in white armor over a black body glove, Stormtroopers make up the bulk of Palpatine's ground-based armies and the space-based imperial Starfleet. Their fearsome looking helmets allow the soldier to breathe in the harshest of enviroments, including the vacuum of space, and are equipped with long range communications allowing these elite shock troops to be deployed with speed and efficiency to quell insurrections and maintain order across the many worlds of the empire. The distinctive design of the Stormtrooper was originally created by concept artist Ralph McQuarrie in 1975. McQuarrie designed several versions of the look of the empire's general infantry. To ensure that your EFX stormtrooper helmet retained all of the subtle nuances of the hand-sculpted original, their engineers digitally scanned and cast a surviving original helmet to recreate this iconic piece of star wars history.",

Cody was often under the command of General Obi-Wan Kenobi, leading Ghost Squadron, and served with him and Anakin Skywalker at Geonosis, Christophsis and during a nearly disastrous campaign on Cato Neimoidia.   Cody developed a close and easygoing camaraderie with Kenobi, easily exchanging dry jokes with his Jedi General. This continued through to their mission to Utapau, to route out the entrenched Separatists forces commanded by General Grievous.   Cody was ultimately subservient to the orders of the Republic, and when Order 66 was enacted -- branding Kenobi an enemy of the state -- Cody willingly carried out the command to open fire on his former friend.  Sideshow and Hot Toys officially introduce the sixth scale Commander Cody Star Wars collectible figure from Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith!

Qui-Gon lived for the moment, espousing a philosophy of 'feel, don't think -- use your instincts.' On Tatooine, Qui-Gon discovered a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who was strong with the Force. Sensing the boy's potential, Qui-Gon liberated Anakin from slavery. The Jedi Master presented Anakin to the Jedi Council, but they deemed the boy too old to begin training and dangerously full of fear and anger. They refused to allow Qui-Gon to train Anakin, but rescinded their decision to fulfill Qui-Gon's dying wish.  Sideshow and Hot Toys are excited to introduce the Qui-Gon Jinn Sixth Scale Collectible Figure from Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace!  Skillfully crafted based on the appearance of Qui-Gon Jinn in the film, this sixth scale collectible Star Wars figure features a newly developed head sculpt, finely tailored Jedi robe and tunic, a desert poncho, LED light-up lightsaber, Comlink, grappling hook, a hologram projector with interchangeable holograms, and a movie-themed figure base!

Jawas are meter-tall humanoids completely hidden behind rough, hand-woven robes. Their faces are concealed within the dark folds of a cowl, from which only their glowing yellow eyes can be seen. They comb the deserts of Tatooine in search of discarded scraps, wayward mechanicals and incapacitated droids to drag to their fortress-homes and immense sand-scarred vehicles known as sandcrawlers. The Jawas sell their hastily refurbished junk to moisture farmers who are hard-pressed to find a better selection elsewhere.  Little more than walking batteries, Power Droids trundle along as directed by their owners or their programming, recharging vehicles and machinery. They are often called Gonk droids in imitation of their simple vocalizations. There are many different models of Power Droids. Although they are common sights throughout the galaxy, Power Droids are often overlooked despite their critical importance to both military and civilian life.  Meticulously created based on the appearance of the two characters in the movie, the Jawa Sixth Scale Collectible Star Wars Figure features a newly developed head with LED lights, a skillfully tailored costume, variety of accessories, and a sand-themed figure base.

    "description": "Sideshow and Regal Robot are proud to present the Mandalorian Skull Wall Decor. At over 17″ tall, this imposing and impressive sculpture was inspired the mysterious skull marking seen on the armor of iconic bounty hunter, Boba Fett. Alternatively referred to as a Bantha skull symbol or a Mythosaur skull symbol over the years, we've created a realistic interpretation of what that skull may have looked like, and the result pops with boldness and character. The classic Star Wars movies are filled with so many great details, any one of which (yes, even a small logo from a character's armor) can be the spark that ignites imagination and leads to a great piece of art that can bring the movies we love into our lives and homes in new ways. While we embrace both digital and practical technology, and this large and intricate sculpture was very much a practical creation. This skull was sculpted in clay, by hand and at full scale, by special effects artist Miyo Nakamura. The sculpture was then hand molded for duplication in rotational cast resin to create the final hollow skulls. Our Mandalorian Skull wall decor sculptures are made in the U.S.A. Each is hand painted in a realistic bone look with layers of antiquing and staining, for the classic lived in look that Star Wars Collectibles are so well known for. The skull ships ready to display and now you can add that look to your space!'",

    "description": "'My films have a tendency to promote personal self-esteem, a you-can-do-it attitude. Their message is:'Don't listen to everyone else. Discover your own feelings and follow them. Then you can overcome anything.'' - George Lucas  Star Wars exploded onto our cinema screens in 1977, and the world has not been the same since. After watching depressing and cynical movies throughout the early 1970s, audiences enthusiastically embraced the positive energy of the Star Wars universe as they followed moisture farmer Luke Skywalker on his journey through a galaxy far, far away, meeting extraordinary characters like mysterious hermit Obi-Wan Kenobi, space pirates Han Solo and Chewbacca, loyal droids C-3PO and R2-D2, bold Princess Leia and the horrific Darth Vader, servant of the dark, malevolent Emperor.  Writer, director, and producer George Lucas created the modern monomyth of our time, one that resonates with the child in us all. He formed Industrial Light &amp; Magic to develop cutting-edge special effects technology, which he combined with innovative editing techniques and a heightened sense of sound to give audiences a unique sensory cinematic experience.  In this first volume, made with the full cooperation of Lucasfilm, Lucas narrates his own story, taking us through the making of the original trilogy—Episode IV: A New Hope, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi—and bringing fresh insights into the creation of a unique universe. Complete with script pages, production documents, concept art, storyboards, on-set photography, stills, and posters, the XXL-sized tome is an authoritative exploration of the original saga as told by its creator.  About the author:  Paul Duncan is a film historian whose TASCHEN books include The James Bond Archives, The Charlie Chaplin Archives, The Godfather Family Album, Taxi Driver, Film Noir, and Horror Cinema, as well as publications on film directors, film genres, movie stars, and film posters.",

    "description": "From the moment Star Wars burst onto the screen in 1977, audiences have been in equal parts fascinated and appalled by the half-man/half-machine hybrid Darth Vader. In 1999, creator George Lucas began the story of how Anakin Skywalker grew up to train as a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi, found love with the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, before turning to the dark side of his nature and becoming more machine than man.  After driving the development of nascent digital technology, George Lucas perceived how he could create new creatures and new worlds on a grander scale than ever before. He created the first digital blockbuster, and met fierce resistance when he pushed for widespread digital cameras, sets, characters, and projection – all of which are now used throughout the industry. He essentially popularized the modern way of making movies.  Made with the full cooperation of George Lucas and Lucasfilm, this second volume covers the making of the prequel trilogy — Episode I The Phantom Menace, Episode II Attack of the Clones, and Episode III Revenge of the Sith — and features exclusive interviews with Lucas and his collaborators. The book is profusely illustrated with script pages, production documents, concept art, storyboards, on-set photography, stills, and posters.  Numbered first printing of 10,000  About the author:  Paul Duncan is a film historian whose TASCHEN books include The James Bond Archives, The Charlie Chaplin Archives, The Godfather Family Album, Taxi Driver, Film Noir, and Horror Cinema, as well as publications on film directors, film genres, movie stars, and film posters.",

A celebrity of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington is the original ceremony master, and idolized by the town's residents! But something is amiss inside and whilst he may not have a real beating heart, he has grown slightly tired of the endless Halloween celebrations year after year. In Disney's animated classic 'Nightmare Before Christmas', our hero Jack stumbles on the wonders of Christmas, and so decides that he too would prepare Christmas festivities for his town. But what crazy shenanigans will the townsfolk, our friendly Jack and his trusty friend Zero end up in?   Sideshow and Beast Kingdom are excited to announce the launch of the latest in the live-action DAH (Dynamic 8ction Heroes) figure range: The Nightmare Before Christmas Jack Skellington. A 1:9 scale highly articulable figure that takes fans to the magical realm of Halloween Town.  The highly detailed figure has 6 replaceable faces, as well as 5 pairs of replaceable hands. Both the hands and face sets include one glow in the dark option to get Jack in the perfect mood for some scary fun. Speaking of glow in the dark, Zero himself, Jack's trusty ghost dog makes an appearance with a nightly glow, so owners are sure to see him by Jack's side every night!   Whilst Jack is considered a master ceremony organizer, he is also a very well dressed organizer, often sporting his dapper white striped tuxedo. The DAH figure doesn't skimp on quality either, with a real fabric tuxedo, paired with his signature exaggerated 'bat bow-tie', our hero is ready to impress at any event!  The DAH Jack Skellington figure is a perfect addition to fans of the Disney animated classic.",

    "description": "It's kind of fun to do the impossible. —Walt Disney  One of the most creative minds of the 20th century, Walt Disney created a unique and unrivaled imaginative universe. Like scarcely any other classics of cinema, his astonishing collection of animated cartoons revolutionized storytelling on screen and enchant to this day across geographies and generations.  In TASCHEN's first volume of one of the most expansive illustrated publications on Disney animation, some 1,500 images and essays by eminent Disney experts take us to the beating heart of the studio's Golden Age of Animation. This landmark book traces Disney's complete animation journey from the silent film era, through his first full-length feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and the pioneering artistic experiment Fantasia (1940), right up to his last masterpieces Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966) and The Jungle Book (1967).  With extensive research conducted through the historical collections of the Walt Disney Company, as well as private collections, editor Daniel Kothenschulte curates some of the most precious concept paintings and storyboards to reveal just how these animation masterpieces came to life. Masterful cel setups provide highly detailed illustrations of famous film scenes while rare pictures taken by Disney photographers and excerpts from story conferences between Walt and his staff bring a privileged insider's view to the studio's creative process.  Each of the major animated features that were made during Walt's lifetime—including Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, and One Hundred and One Dalmatians—are given their own focus chapter, without forgetting less familiar gems such as the experimental short films of the Silly Symphonies series and underappreciated episodic musical films such as Make Mine Music and Melody Time, all of which receive the same meticulous research and attention. Many unfinished projects, amon",

    "description": "On November 18, 1928, the world's most famous mouse made his very first public debut. Today, we celebrate 90 years of Mickey in one of the most expansive illustrated publications on the Disney universe. Starting with the first sketches of a character who was almost named Mortimer, we trace the career of Walt Disney's and Ub Iwerks's most famous creation, one met with an explosion of worldwide popularity preceded only by the earlier successes of Charlie Chaplin.  With unlimited access to Disney's vast historical collections as well as public and private collections, the authors bring Mickey's success story to life: concept art, story sketches, background paintings, and animation drawings, as well as historical photographs, trace the origins and evolution of such timeless favorites as Steamboat Willie, The Band Concert, and Brave Little Tailor. They also follow Mickey as he builds on this legendary library of short cartoons by appearing in two historic feature-length films, Fantasia and Fun and Fancy Free.  Unfinished projects, many of them presented for the first time through original storyboard drawings, unveil a Mickey that might have been. Extensive archival research sheds new light on little-known chapters of Mickey's career, such as his pioneering radio shows, the origins of the Mickey Mouse Club, and his use as a patriotic icon during World War II. Along the way, we encounter the work of all major Mickey artists in both film and comics, including such greats as Ub Iwerks, Win Smith, Ferdinand Horvath, Fred Moore, Floyd Gottfredson, Carl Barks, Manuel Gonzales, Paul Murry, Romano Scarpa, Giorgio Cavazzano, Byron Erickson, César Ferioli, and Noel Van Horn.  Mickey Mouse has left an indelible mark on everyday culture as well as high art, becoming a favored subject for Pop artists such as Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Roy Lichtenstein. As Walt Disney once said: I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing—that it was all started by a mouse. And",

A faceted gem-like pattern runs down her sleeves while sculptural elements surrounding her skirt recreate tambour beading and Nordic embroidery patterns. Artisans hand-painted Elsa's outfit on this stone resin figure to evoke fabrics of silk organza, twill, lace, suede and leather as well as to evoke embellishments of crystals, sequins, pearl studs, metallics, and gemstones.

    "description": "'To all who come to this happy place: Welcome.' - Walt Disney  Walt Disney dreamed for decades about opening the ultimate entertainment venue, but it wasn't until the early 1950s that his handpicked team began to bring his vision to life. Together, artists, architects, and engineers transformed a dusty tract of orange groves about an hour south of Los Angeles into one of the world's most beloved destinations.  Today, there are Disney resorts from Paris to Shanghai, but the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which has been visited by more than 800 million people to-date, remains one of America's most popular attractions. From the day it opened on July 17, 1955, Disneyland brought history and fairy tales to life, the future into the present, and exciting cultures and galaxies unknown to our imaginations.  This bountiful visual history draws on Disney's vast historical collections, private archives, and the golden age of photojournalism to provide unique access to the concept, development, launch, and enjoyment of this sun-drenched oasis of fun and fantasy. Disneyland documents Walt's earliest inspirations and ideas; the park's extraordinary feats of design and engineering; it's grand opening; each of its immersive lands from Main Street, U.S.A., to Tomorrowland; and the park's evolution through the six decades since it opened. It is a treasure trove of original Disney documentation and expertise, with award-winning writer Chris Nichols drawing on his extensive knowledge of both Disneyland and Southern California history to reveal the fascinating tale of the happiest place on Earth.   About the Editor and Author:  Chris Nichols is a writer and historian specializing in Southern Californian architecture and culture. He is the author of The Leisure Architecture of Wayne McAllister and a long-time historic preservationist whose work has been profiled in Smithsonian magazine, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and LA Weekly.

Romero Britto reimagines Disney's most beloved characters in works of art popping with bursts of color and exquisite detail.

It is a reflection of what words fail to express about the joys of life. Never forgetting his humble roots, Britto has donated his talent, time and enthusiasm to over 1,000 charitable organizations worldwide.",

    "description": "Sideshow and Mondo present from their first line of officially-licensed Disney Tiki Mugs, Sorcerer Mickey from 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' segment in the iconic, groundbreaking animated film FANTASIA. The boldly blue Elemental Variant stands tall at 11.5' and holds approximately 22 ounces, which should be plenty of room to flood your own chamber.  Designed by Tom Thor Thordarson and sculpted by Istanbul-based Tufan Sezer, it's produced by the sorcerers over at Tiki Farm. They make each of the mugs by hand, which means they're all unique pieces of drinkware art (and there could be some slight variations from the images above).",
